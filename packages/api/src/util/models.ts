// This file's content is snatched straight out of our generated @prisma/client
// It's here because we need it for Routes to use types that DON'T rely on prisma
// Because otherwise we would need to somehow share our prisma.schema (and 2 others) with the frontend
// Which would NOT work. Absolutely make sure to use the types below and to cast away any types from @prsisma/client
